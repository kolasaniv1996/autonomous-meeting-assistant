- Added session management and token refresh

### 3. Agent Page Integration Issues ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: The agent page had integration problems and was not properly connected to the backend.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created comprehensive Agents.jsx page with full agent management
- Implemented agent CRUD operations
- Added agent status monitoring and control
- Integrated with configuration system for API credentials
- Added agent assignment to meetings functionality

### 4. Schedule Link Functionality Missing ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Meeting scheduling functionality was broken or missing.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created comprehensive Meetings.jsx page
- Implemented meeting scheduling with calendar integration
- Added agent assignment to meetings
- Created meeting status tracking
- Added meeting conflict detection
- Implemented meeting reminders and notifications

### 5. Empty Settings Page ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: The settings page was empty and non-functional.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created comprehensive Settings.jsx page
- Added system-wide configuration options
- Implemented user preference settings
- Added notification settings (email, in-app, webhook)
- Created API rate limiting configuration
- Added logging level configuration
- Implemented backup and restore functionality

## Technical Implementation Details

### Backend (Flask) Architecture
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with secure password hashing
- **Database**: SQLite with comprehensive schema including 11 tables
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful API with proper error handling
- **Security**: Input validation, rate limiting, CORS protection
- **Health Monitoring**: Health check endpoints for monitoring

### Frontend (React) Architecture
- **Authentication**: Context-based authentication with protected routes

- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface

### Database Schema
Comprehensive database design with the following tables:
- `users` - User accounts and authentication
- `user_sessions` - JWT session management
- `user_configurations` - API credentials and configurations
- `agents` - Autonomous meeting agents
- `meetings` - Scheduled meetings
- `settings` - User preferences and system settings
- `meeting_participants` - Agent-meeting assignments
- `meeting_transcripts` - Meeting transcriptions
- `action_items` - Extracted action items
- `integration_logs` - API integration logs
- `audit_logs` - System audit trail

### Deployment Infrastructure
- **Docker**: Containerized application with multi-stage builds
- **Docker Compose**: Complete stack deployment
- **Kubernetes**: Helm chart for production deployment
- **Nginx**: Reverse proxy and static file serving
- **Health Checks**: Monitoring and alerting capabilities

## Security Enhancements

1. **Authentication Security**:
   - JWT tokens with configurable expiration
   - Secure password hashing with bcrypt
   - Session management and token refresh

2. **API Security**:
   - Rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - CORS protection
   - Audit logging for all user actions

3. **Infrastructure Security**:
   - Environment variable management
   - Secrets management in Kubernetes
   - Security headers in nginx configuration

## Testing and Quality Assurance

1. **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test suite for authentication endpoints
2. **Integration Tests**: API endpoint testing with proper authentication
3. **Health Monitoring**: Health check endpoints for system monitoring
4. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling and user feedback

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Docker Compose (Recommended for Development)
```bash
./deploy.sh
```

### Option 2: Kubernetes with Helm (Production)
```bash
helm install meeting-assistant ./helm-chart \
  --set auth.jwtSecret="your-secure-jwt-secret" \
  --set auth.adminPassword="your-admin-password"
```

### Option 3: Development Setup
```bash
./setup-dev.sh
```
